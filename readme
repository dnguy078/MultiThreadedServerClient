A multi-threaded client that will do a remote copy (from server machine to client machine) of files from your servers below.  Your client should create 10 threads to read files, then start a timer, have each of the 10 threads copy all the files in the list of files to copy, then stop the timer, and report the elapsed user time.  Each thread should copy the files into a directory with a unique name, such as hw/hw9/Thread1files, etc.

Thread Per Request Server: a multi-threaded server that delivers files to clients above using thread per connection (or request as there will be only one file requested per connection).  It will create a new thread for each client request. Note there are 10 threads each requesting a copy of 14 files, so there will be 140 threads created in this testing example.
